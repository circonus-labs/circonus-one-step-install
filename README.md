# COSI - The Circonus One Step Installer

The purpose of COSI is to simplify the task of getting metrics flowing from a new host into Circonus, consisting of:

1. Install and configure the Circonus monitoring agent [nad](https://github.com/circonus-labs/nad)

1. Create and configure a Circonus check that receives data from the agent

1. Create graphs and worksheets for each of the basic metric groups (e.g. cpu, memory, disk, network, filesystem, etc.)

COSI automates all these steps with a single cut-n-paste command without inhibiting customization and orchestration/automation.
In addition it provides a command line utility command, for managing the Circonus check for the hosts.

## Quickstart

In most cases, you will want to use the Circonus UI to install COSI on your host:

1. Log into your Circonus Account

1. Go to the Checks page, click `[NEW HOST+]` on the top right.

1. Copy and run the command displayed on the host to be setup.
